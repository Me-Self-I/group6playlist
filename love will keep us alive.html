        <h1>Love Will Keep Us Alive
            Song by Eagles</h1>
           <h3>I was standing
            All alone against the world outside
            You were searching
            For a place to hide
            Lost and lonely
            Now you've given me the will to survive
            When we're hungry
            Love will keep us alive
            Don't you worry
            Sometimes you've just gotta let it ride
            The world is changing
            Right before your eyes
            Now I've found you
            There's no more emptiness inside
            When we're hungry
            Love will keep us alive
            I would die for you
            Climb the highest mountain
            Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
            Now I've found you
            There's no more emptiness inside
            When we're hungry
            Love will keep us alive
            I would die for you
            Climb the highest mountain
            Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
            I was standing
            All alone against the world outside
            You were searching
            For a place to hide
            Lost and lonely
            Now you've given me the will to survive
            When we're hungry
            Love will keep us alive
            When we're hungry
            Love will keep us alive
            When we're hungry
            Love will keep us alive
