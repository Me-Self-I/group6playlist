           <h3>

            Oceans apart, day after day
            And I slowly go insane
            I hear your voice on the line
            But it doesn't stop the pain
            
            If I see you next to never
            How can we say forever?
            
            Wherever you go, whatever you do
            I will be right here waiting for you
            Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
            I will be right here waiting for you
            
            I took for granted, all the times
            That I thought would last somehow
            I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
            But I can't get near you now
            
            Oh, can't you see it, baby
            You've got me going crazy
            
            Wherever you go, whatever you do
            I will be right here waiting for you
            Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
            I will be right here waiting for you
            
            I wonder how we can survive
            This romance
            But in the end if I'm with you
            I'll take the chance
            
            Oh, can't you see it, baby
            You've got me going crazy
            
            Wherever you go, whatever you do
            I will be right here waiting for you
            Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
            I will be right here waiting for you
            Waiting for you
